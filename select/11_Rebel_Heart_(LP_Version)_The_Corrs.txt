(Instrumental)

"I wrote it in Malibu on piano when we were recording "Talk On Corners." It sat around for a long time and then the BBC were looking for some music for their big autumn drama about the 1916 Easter Rising in Ireland. It has a very Irish melody and we added the tin whistle and so on and it fitted the bill." - Sharon
