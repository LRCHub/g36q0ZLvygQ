Medieval warrior bitch goddess
That's what I'm going for

Blood, sweat and tears
(Blood, sweat, tears)

When you are prepared for anything
You are prepared for war

This is the beginning of a crazy ride
The great thing about the war that we fight every night
Is that we bring no harm to people
We just bring love, inspiration
And people need it

Blood, sweat and tears
This is it, people
It's showtime

I'm a woman
I'm a blonde
I have tits and an ass
And an insatiable desire to be noticed
"Come on, baby. Show us your ass"
Iconic
"Shake it for us, baby. Do that dance you do so well for us, baby"
Ok
But I still want to start a revolution
Somebody's got to

Want to be a superstar
That's exactly what you are
Want to be a superstar
That's exactly what you are

There's too much beauty in the world going to waste
Too much talent going unnoticed
Too much creativity being crushed beneath the
Wheel of corporate branding and what's trending
But it's time to wake up

Want to be a superstar
And I looked into the eyes of people and I saw helplessness
That's exactly what you are
I saw hopelessness
I saw humans searching for a way out

Watch me people
I'm great and I'm somebody
I've been up and down so many times
No one is gonna ever stop me, 'cause I'm somebody
I'm beautiful

Because when those Fascist dictators posing as righteous men come for you
With their big leather boots to shut you up
To put a gag in your mouth

You better be prepared to fight for what you believe in
You better be prepared to die for what you believe in

I want to start a revolution
