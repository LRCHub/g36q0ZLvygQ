Tonight I'm leavin' on the midnight train
To stay would be to leave a lie
I'm stingin' from the fire of your farewell kiss
Disappointment in your eyes
I left you in the rain
So I wouldn't see you cry
I can't escape the pain
When it's you that I want
But I can't tie my love down inside
I Got A Rebel Heart
I gotta run and it's tearing me apart.
I Got A Rebel Heart
And as long as it's beating, It's always breaking
Tomorrow I'll be far away from here
Not far enough to ease the pain
Will you leave a light on in the night for me
Will I jump this midnight train?
I'm standing in the rain
So no one can see me cry
My tears are shed in vain
Cuz nothing can change
The will of this cold wind inside
I Got A Rebel Heart
I gotta run and it's tearing me apart
I Got A Rebel Heart
And as long as it's beating, It's always breaking
I left you in the rain
So I wouldn't' see you cry
I can't escape the pain
When it's you that I want
But I can't tie my love down inside
I Got A Rebel Heart
I gotta run and it's tearing me apart
I Got A Rebel Heart
And as long as it's beating
Oh, It's always breaking
I Got A Rebel Heart
It's always breaking
I Got A Rebel Heart
I gotta run and it's tearing me apart
I Got A Rebel Heart
I Got A Rebel Heart
I Got A Rebel Heart
